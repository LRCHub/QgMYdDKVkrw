[01:00.48] I know that you're hiding something from me
[01:03.90] That's been close to your heart
[01:06.99] And I felt it creeping up every day
[01:10.86] Baby, right from the start
[01:14.05] I know that look you give when we're fighting (fighting)
[01:17.49] We're fighting (fighting)
[01:19.59] 'Cause I used to be the one who was lying (lying)
[01:24.03] Oh, lying (lying)
[01:32.53] 
[01:27.00] Oh, is there someone else or not?
[01:31.86] 'Cause I wanna keep you close
[01:34.59] I don't wanna lose my spot
[01:38.17] 'Cause I need to know
[01:40.59] If you're hurting him, or you're hurting me
[01:43.94] If I ain't with you, I don't wanna be
[01:48.00] Is there someone else or not?
[01:52.11] Ooh, or not?
[01:58.11] 
[01:56.89] I don't deservе someone loyal to me
[02:01.11] Don't you think I see?
[02:03.82] And I don't want to bе a prisoner to who I used to be
[02:09.80] I swear I changed my ways for the better, the better
[02:15.13] 'Cause I wanna be with you forever, forever
[02:36.63] 
[02:22.75] Oh, is there someone else or not?
[02:28.10] 'Cause I wanna keep you close
[02:31.63] I don't wanna lose my spot
[02:34.82] 'Cause I need to know
[02:37.25] If you're hurting him, or you're hurting me
[02:40.92] If I ain't with you, I don't wanna be
[02:45.26] Is there someone else or not?
[02:49.40] Ooh, or not?
[02:55.40] 
[02:53.99] Whoa, yeah
[02:59.95] Hey!
[03:03.28] Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
[03:05.89] Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh-oh
[03:12.45] Hey!
