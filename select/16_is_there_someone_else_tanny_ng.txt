verse 1
walking this park all alone
reflecting what happened for more
it's not like i'm closing my doors
i just hate being hurt like before
so i'm just so closed in
much overthinking and
breaking my patience
but still i'm not ready for love
not ready for love
pre-chorus
but i miss
affection
so i ask
chorus
is there someone else
out there
for me?
is there someone else
for me
to love?
verse 2
up on the subway alone
the pictures still lay on my phone
i feel like i'm still holding on
to her
because she broke that heart into two
and i'm scared to have deja vù
that one day it would happen again
pre-chorus
but i miss
affection
so i ask
chorus
is there someone else
out there
for me?
is there someone else
for me
to love?
oh
